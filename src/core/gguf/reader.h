// Reads a GGUF file's header, metadata and tensor index from an untrusted
// source into `out`.
//
//   - Never reads outside the file. Every offset and length is validated
//     against the source's authoritative size, with checked arithmetic.
//   - Never throws. Failures are named values (E.27).
//   - Reads the index only, never tensor data, so only the front of the file
//     needs to be resident. When a read reaches bytes that are not,
//     the result is NeedMoreBytes with how many bytes to supply.
//     Optimization (browser): the page judges a model from its first bytes,
//     16 MiB of a 700 MB file, before deciding to download the rest.
//   - Records every tensor, whatever its format. A format the harness cannot
//     run is not an error here; preflight decides, and names the tensor.
//   - Leaves `out` untouched unless the read succeeds.
