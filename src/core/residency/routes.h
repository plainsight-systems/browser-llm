// Axis D: changes with the WebGPU surface or the limits a device grants.
//
// Where every byte of the file goes. A pure function of the tensor index, the
// residency plan and the duplicates the page has confirmed: one route for
// each piece of each weight, in file order, saying which bytes of the file
// it takes and where in which buffer they land. No GPU, no browser; upload
// carries the routes out (upload.h), and they are tested without a device.
//
//   - A route takes a run of whole rows, so whole blocks, as the plan's piece
//     does, and lays them out as its format's device layout says
//     (formats/device_layout.h). Its destination length is the piece's bound
//     length, which that layout fills exactly.
//   - A tensor's format is found through the lookup the caller passes: the
//     capability table's find_format in the harness, so the formats upload
//     routes are exactly the ones preflight passed; a table of the test's own
//     in a test. A format it does not list is a named failure.
//   - Every offset and length is checked against the file's size before any
//     byte arrives, by subtraction so no sum can wrap (WASM.9, ES.103). A
//     route that would read past the file, or write past its buffer, is a
//     named failure, not a write.
//   - A confirmed duplicate takes no route: its bytes go nowhere, its view
//     reads the tensor it copies, and its buffers are never created. Which
//     duplicates are confirmed is decided before upload, by comparing the two
//     tensors' bytes in the cached file (web/duplicates.js); a candidate that
//     is not confirmed is routed like any tensor, into the buffers the plan
//     gave it.
//     Optimization (practice): a head stored as a copy of the embedding is
//     the same tied weight written twice. Sharing it keeps one copy on the
//     device, as a model saved with tied weights does; the plan never counts
//     on it (plan.h).
//
// Guidelines, by corpus:
//   C++ Core Guidelines
//     F.8    Prefer pure functions — no GPU, no I/O, so every rule is tested
//            natively.
//     E.27   If you can't throw exceptions, use error codes systematically —
//            RouteError, with the tensor at fault as its subject.
//     ES.103 Don't overflow — ranges are checked by subtraction.
//     F.20, F.21 prefer returning values to out parameters. Deliberately not
//            followed: out parameters match plan_residency and the loaders,
//            and leave the caller's objects untouched unless the call
//            succeeds.
//   C++ performance guidelines
//     WASM.9 Stream assets and keep them compressed to their destination —
//            every offset is validated against the file's authoritative size,
//            with checked arithmetic, before any byte arrives.

// Finds the format a tensor type runs as, or null if it runs as none.
