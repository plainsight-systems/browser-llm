// Axis D: changes with the WebGPU surface or the limits a device grants.
//
// The Upload stage's own test, in a diagnostic build only: every byte upload
// wrote is read back from the device and compared, byte for byte, with what
// it should be. A sampled check passes while another chunk sits at the wrong
// offset; WASM.9 asks for every byte or no claim of integrity.
//
//   - What each range should hold is regenerated, not remembered: once upload
//     has finished, the page streams the cached file a second time, and a
//     fresh PieceWriter over the routes the Upload itself used — taken from
//     it, never passed in beside it, so the check cannot be pointed at other
//     routes and pass having compared nothing — turns it into the same writes
//     upload issued; it is deterministic (piece_writer.h). Nothing the size of
//     the model is kept to compare against.
//   - Every comparison rests on a completed mapping, which a lost device
//     refuses (upload.h), so a check on a lost device fails and never ends
//     with zero mismatches having compared nothing. A chunk's mapping is read
//     by mapping_result (mapping.h), the witness's own classifier: Ok is
//     compared; Cancelled, Internal and DeviceLost are themselves;
//     Unexplained is MapFailed. It holds its own references to the device
//     and the instance, as Upload does. Its callbacks keep
//     their state alive on their own, as Upload's do: its destructor marks
//     them cancelled, so destroying a check with a comparison pending reports
//     Cancelled instead of touching freed memory.
//   - For each chunk, every write's range is copied into one mappable staging
//     buffer, back to back, in one command buffer; the staging buffer is
//     mapped once, and each range is compared with the write's bytes. The
//     chunk is acknowledged only after that comparison, so the chunk and the
//     writer's staging the writes point into are still intact when compared.
//     The readback is bounded by a chunk, as the upload was.
//   - The result names every mismatch: the buffer, the offset of its first
//     differing byte, and the tensor the route belongs to, by the name the
//     Upload kept. Zero mismatches
//     means every byte written is on the device where the plan put it.
//     Padding upload never wrote is not compared: WebGPU zeroes new buffers,
//     and nothing reads past a piece's file bytes but its unpack.
//
// Compiled only with diagnostics: CMake leaves its source out of every other
// build, so the shipped module holds none of it. A load timed
// in that build is a diagnostic figure, never a load-throughput one (TLM.6).
//
// Guidelines, by corpus:
//   C++ Core Guidelines
//     P.6    What cannot be checked at compile time should be checkable at run
//            time — where the bytes landed is checked on the device itself.
//     R.1    Manage resources automatically using RAII — the staging buffer
//            and the device reference are RAII handles.
//     E.27   Use error codes systematically — CheckError, and mismatches as
//            data, never a log line.
//     C.21   If you define or =delete any copy, move, or destructor
//            function, define or =delete them all — its destructor cancels
//            pending callbacks, so copy and move are each deleted, not left
//            implicit; its owner holds it in place.
//   C++ performance guidelines
//     COPY.4 Never declare only a destructor — the same four deletions.
//     WASM.9 Stream assets in bounded chunks; its Caveats: "A sampled
//            verification proves very little... Verify every byte, in a
//            diagnostic pass, or do not claim integrity." — every byte written
//            is compared, none sampled, a chunk at a time.
//     GPU.1  Budget every round trip — the whole model is read back once, in
//            this build only.
//     TLM.6  Diagnostic mode is not benchmark mode — what this build times
//            is labelled diagnostic and kept apart from the release figures.
