"""Fetches native Dawn, prebuilt by its own release CI, as pinned in
cmake/dawn.json.

The native build links Dawn so that GPU code, which the browser runs through
emdawnwebgpu, is also tested natively: the same webgpu.h, from the same Dawn
release. This downloads this platform's prebuilt archive, verifies it against
its pinned SHA-256, and unpacks it into .cache/dawn/<release>/<platform>/, the
directory CMakeLists.txt reads the same pin file to find. An archive that does
not match its pin is not unpacked, and the run fails. One already unpacked is
not fetched again.

Standard library only, so CI runs it without installing anything.
